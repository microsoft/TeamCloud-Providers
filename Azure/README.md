# Azure Providers

This directory contains TeamCloud Providers that can create and manage Azure resources.

Initially, this directory will include Providers for:

- [Azure Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)
- [Azure DevTest Labs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devtest-lab/)
- [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/)
- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/)

**Note: TeamCloud and the Providers in this repository are in active development and will change.**  As the these Providers become ready for use, they will be [versioned](https://semver.org/) and released.

## Deploy

Deploying Azure Provider resources is as simple as clicking the associated _"Deploy to Azure"_ link below and filling in a few fields.  Below is a brief explanation for filling in each field, please [file an issue](issues/new?labels=docs) if you have questions or require additional help.

- **`Subscription`** Select the Azure subscription you want deploy the Provider.  It's okay if you only have one choice, or you don't see this option at all.
- **`Resource group`** Unless you have an existing Resource group that you want to use, select __Create new__ and provide a name for the new group.  _(a resource group is essentially a parent folder where the resources will be deployed).
- **`Location`** Select the region to deploy the new resources. You should choose a region that best matches your (or your user's) location.
- **`Function App Name`** Provide a name for your app.  This can be the same name as your Resource group, and will be used as the subdomain for your Provider's endpoint.  For example, if you used `superawesome`, your Provider URL would be `superawesome.azurewebsites.net/api`.
- **`Deploy Provider Source`** Select true to deploy the Azure Resources as well as the Provider source code from GitHub.  Select false to only deploy the Azure Resources.
- **Agree & Purchase:** Read and agree to the _TERMS AND CONDITIONS_, then click _Purchase_.
